## Intro
At Rows we create tools that make computation accessible to everyone.
Coding used to be hard. Rows changes that. We want you to create interactive web apps using the spreadsheet skills that you already have. Imagine a grid where each cell can exchange data with other online services or repeat a job. This is what we’re building.

[Rows](https://rows.com/) is a well-funded startup with top investors like Accel, Lakestar and Cherry Ventures. We are a team of 50 who want to empower business people to take their life into their own hands again and build the tools they need for their jobs themselves. We have offices in Berlin - a business team of 5 - and Porto - a tech team of 45.

# Your role

We are hiring a Chief of Staff in one of our offices in Berlin (Germany) or Porto (Portugal). You will work directly with Rows founders to ensure strong results across our organization in tech and business teams. You will also own special projects and prepare and support our work on funding rounds.

You will get a front-row seat taking a company from 0 to 1. You will do most things founders do, from the simple (booking and running a meeting) to the complex (a rebrand). You'll directly work with most managers and get exposure to fundraising. You will also get to know all parts of a tech organization, from engineering and product to marketing and sales. After 2 years, we'll speak about what next challenge is best for you - either at Rows or potentially starting your own company.

# Your responsibilities

* Be the extended hand of the founders inside the company, and help founders be more productive in topics big and small.
* Ensure meetings are impactful and have clearly documented decisions and next steps, in all teams.

* Support company and team leadership in creating more effective processes and better documentation for their teams.

_Selectively_
* Participate in fundraising, incl. venture capital and public grants.
* Participate in key product, marketing and HR meetings.

_Weekly_

* You love spreadsheets and you love presentation software - you are proficient at building presentations and models.
* You are very knowledgeable about Rows’s product, our industry, business model, and about how tech organizations work.
