# What is Rows?

Imagine a spreadsheet grid that enables users to create interactive web apps by calling an API or repeating a job, using the spreadsheet skills they already have - no code needed. This is what we are building. Don’t let the word “spreadsheet” intimidate you - what we are trying to do is to improve the existing user experience of a spreadsheet by creating something unique and easy to use. Plus, we are just starting, meaning you will have freedom to experiment and lots of flexibility on a daily basis.

We have also been on the news. You can find us on [TechCrunch](https://tcrn.ch/3dEhNKD), [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/23/rows-raises-16-million-and-launches-next-gen-spreadsheets-with-built-in-data-integrations/), [Eco Sapo (PT)](https://eco.sapo.pt/2021/02/23/rows-capta-13-milhoes-em-serie-b-para-continuar-a-fazer-crescer-equipa-e-produto-entre-o-porto-e-berlim/), [Business Insider (DE)](https://www.businessinsider.de/gruenderszene/rows-excel-konkurrent-finanzierung/) and many other media!

# Your impact
We’re looking for an awesome Product Designer to join our team in Porto.

## What you will do:
* Partner with engineers and product owners to design solutions that oversee the user experience from conception until launch.
* Be involved in design initiatives across the entire product lifecycle and multiple product launches.
* Envision ways of expanding and applying our brand across the different sections of our product and multiple channels like social media or marketing.
* Deliver polished interfaces and awesome visual outputs that help us create a next-level experience for our users!
* Learn from our awesome team of designers, engineers and product owners.
* Provide and solicite feedback from our team of designers to constantly improve your work and make Rows even greater.

## In this role, you will:
* Set the vision for the whole experience, working in different areas of the product such as the Editor and the Workspace.
* Validate your designs through user-testing and/or feedback from our users.
* Showcase designs as necessary to Business, Product and Engineering Teams.
* Quickly and thoughtfully incorporate team feedback into designs.
* Maintain, update, and improve the existing design component library.

# About you
We're looking for people who improve our team! Our ideal buddy is:
* Motivated to solve complex challenges. We are building a platform that provides Computing to the masses; this requires cooking up new design solutions.
* Eager to work with cross-functional teams. You’ll partner closely with product and engineering. Together, you will come up with solutions that delight our users.
* Professional and fun. We value commitment and the ability to stay optimistic and focused, especially in the face of difficult challenges or feedback. But we also find plenty of time to talk about The Big Lebowski.
* Focused on quality and usability. We hate alarms going off and features that are half-designed as much as you do. Come build a polished product with us!

# The Must-Have
* 3+ years of proven experience designing at business-focused companies or agencies.
* Knowledge of UX best practices and heuristics and understanding of what constitutes a good or bad experience.
* Ability to translate complex requirements and user research into simple visual solutions.
* Understanding of visual design best practices such as composition, grid, balance, symmetry, typography, color usage and use of white space.
* A refined aesthetic sense that can help us expand our brand across different mediums/channels.
* Flexibility for switching tasks easily and being able to design not only for the core product, but also brand and marketing related outputs.
* Knowledge about the fundamentals of web (html & css), understanding of technical limitations and good communication skills with FE dev teams.
* Concept idealization and great product vision while still being able to work in IA, user journeys, wireframes and edge cases.
* Autonomy and ownership of design processes.
* Proficiency with Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and other prototyping tools.
* A relevant and awesome online Portfolio or PDF reflecting both UX and visual skills.

Also, if we call your mom she will say you're a pretty nice person ;)
