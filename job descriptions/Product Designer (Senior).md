# What is Rows?

Imagine a spreadsheet grid that enables users to create interactive web apps by calling an API or repeating a job, using the spreadsheet skills they already have - no code needed. This is what we are building. Don’t let the word “spreadsheet” intimidate you - what we are trying to do is to improve the existing user experience of a spreadsheet by creating something unique and easy to use. Plus, we are just starting, meaning you will have freedom to experiment and lots of flexibility on a daily basis.

We have also been on the news.

# About you
We're looking for people who improve our team! Our ideal buddy is:

* A refined aesthetic sense that can help us expand our brand across different mediums/channels.
* Flexibility for switching tasks easily and being able to design not only for the core product, but also brand and marketing related outputs.
* Knowledge about the fundamentals of web (html & css), understanding of technical limitations and good communication skills with FE dev teams.
* Concept idealization and great product vision while still being able to work in IA, user journeys, wireframes and edge cases.
* Autonomy and ownership of design processes.
* Proficiency with Sketch and/or Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop and simple prototyping tools such as Invision.
* A relevant and awesome online Portfolio or PDF reflecting both UX and visual skills.
* Previous experience in software products, including B2C and B2B ambients.
