## Where are your offices?
Porto (Portugal) and Berlin (Germany).

## How is life in Porto?
Terrific.

## How is life in Berlin?
Swell.

## Where do you enable remote work?
In addition to Portugal and Germany (where our offices are located), we enable remote work in Brazil, the United States, and 19 European countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, the UK. We will work to add more countries to the list, depending on their talent pool, time zones between U.S. East Cost and Europe, visa-free travel to Europe, and total labor cost.

## Why are you enabling remote?
During the pandemic we have seen that technology enables us to work together effectively even at a distance. It’s become clear to us that the people we want to hire and retain insist on their choice to live where they want. Making great engineers and marketers upend their own and their families’ lives for a new job and relocating them will become stuff of the past. Unless they want to move to a different city anyway. 

## How do you work to make your hybrid setup work?
* We have limited meetings for engineers to 2 days, and we have moved our work to be largely async.
* We still believe it’s critical to spend time together face-to-face. It’s just more fun and more effective in building deeper and more trustful relationships. We keep our annual in-person retreat for the entire company. We also give a budget to every team to get together in off-sites for up to one week.
* Our offices became a flexible work, socializing, and event space. As has been the case since the start of the pandemic, all meetings are remote-first.

## Do you still sponsor relocations of international candidates to your office locations?
We do. Be aware that getting VISAs to come and work in the EU may take a long time. But we like everyone!

## Do you allow for 4-day work weeks?
Yes, we offer 4-day work weeks at pro-rated compensation (80%) to those who want it.

## What do you mean by "unlimited vacation"?
We mean that you should rest whenever you need to. Everyone in the company get a number of paid vacation days (determined by country laws). On top of this, we give you a permission to leave for (unpaid) vacation days.

## How may additional paid vacation days can I get?
People who are with us for 3 years get 2 additional paid vacation days, and if they reach the 5 years mark they get 2 days more. Therefore, you can add up a total of 4 vacations days to your legal vacation.

## How does you compensation model look like?
We are harmonizing compensation across Europe, and we will keep compensation world-wide at least at 80% of our European levels. This means that compensation is simplified with the same pay for the same work in all European countries. For non-European countries where we allow remote - currently Brazil and the US - compensation is adapted based on cost of market.

## Do you guys attend conferences and workshops?
We do. Here's a [list of events](https://github.com/rows/community) we go to.

## Do you have an On-Call Support schedule?
Yes, we do. All of our Engineers are entitled to be part of the on-call support schedule, which means one of them per week is first line of contact if any incident happens within our product.

Of value this on-call time and so engineers receive a fixed amount per on-call week just to be scheduled for on-call, even if no incident happens. If an incident happens during non-working hours, we pay engineers their hourly wage plus an extra amount for the time worked. The extra amount is determined by Portuguese Work law.

## Do you provide any health insurance?
Yes, we do in Porto, where all Rowers are included in our health plan, so they enjoy a premium healthcare service at a low price. Besides, we know how important their family is for them, so we also include spouses and children in our health insurance plan, without any cost. Our plan is the Multicare 3 health plan.

In Berlin, we provide the 50% employer contribution to social charges which is regular in Germany.

In countries where we don't have a legal entity, we hire through remote.com, making sure we comply with local legal requirements, including mandatory benefits, which in some countries involves health insurance.
